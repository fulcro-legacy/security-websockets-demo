== Fulcro Security Demo for Websockets

This source code goes with the Security chapter of the
http://book.fulcrologic.com[Fulcro Developer's Guide], and
demonstrates setting up network-layer security for
websockets.

Please see the book for more details.

=== Running

This is a shadow-cljs project:

```
$ npm install
$ npx shadow-cljs watch main
```

Then run a REPL:

```
$ lein repl
user=> (start)
```

This will start in development mode (no SSL redirect).

=== Production Mode

```
$ lein uberjar
$ (cd target; java -jar security_demo.jar)
```

but you'll need a proxy server like nginx with SSL in front of it.  If you
general a self-signed cert and put the files in your nginx folder, then
something like this should work:

```
    server {
       listen 80;
       server_name 127.0.0.1;

       location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
    }

    server {
       listen 443 http2 ssl;
       server_name 127.0.0.1;

        ssl_certificate      ssl/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  ssl/server.key;
        ssl_dhparam          ssl/dhparam.pem;

       location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
    }
```

NOTE: For my quick tests I did an insecure thing and put self-signed ssl files in
/usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl.  The above file was in
`/usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/security-demo/conf`.

You'll have to run `nginx` via sudo to use the restricted ports:

```
$ sudo nginx
```

Of course you'll still get a big fat warning from the browser that the cert is
bad, but you'll be able to test the app to see it working and forcing redirects.
